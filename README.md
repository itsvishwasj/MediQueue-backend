# MediQueue: AI-Powered Symptom Triage & Live Queue Management (Hackathon Project)

**MediQueue** is a full-stack healthcare solution designed to reduce hospital overcrowding and streamline the patient experience. By leveraging **Google Gemini AI** for intelligent symptom triage and providing **Real-time Queue Status**, MediQueue ensures patients get to the right specialist without the wait.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **AI-Driven Triage:** An interactive symptom checker powered by Gemini AI that asks follow-up questions to recommend the correct hospital department.
* **Live Queue Monitoring:** Real-time visibility into current wait times and queue positions for different hospital departments.
* **Admin Dashboard:** A centralized portal for hospital staff to manage appointments, update queue statuses, and view patient triage data.
* **Smart Travel Integration:** (Planned) Built-in travel planning and expense splitting for patients traveling from rural areas.
* **Voice-Enabled Input:** Integrated Speech-to-Text for a hands-free symptom description experience.

## 📋 How It Works

1.  **Patient Input:** The patient enters symptoms via text or voice in the Flutter app.
2.  **AI Analysis:** The Gemini-powered backend analyzes the input, asks clarifying questions, and recommends a specific department (e.g., Cardiology, ENT).
3.  **Booking:** The patient views the **Live Queue** and books a slot.
4.  **Hospital Management:** Hospital staff receive the booking on the **Admin Portal** and manage the patient's flow in real-time.
